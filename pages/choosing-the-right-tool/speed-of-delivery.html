<h3>The Speed of Delivery</h3>

<ul class="ft-fragment">
  <li>Delivering requires balancing operational and strategic speed</li>
  <li class="ft-fragment">Picking good tools, and the right tool for the job (and maybe not picking one at all) are all about understanding this balance</li>
  <li class="ft-fragment">Long-term success requires strategic speed, not operational, speed. Keep that in mind when balancing.</li>
</ul>
