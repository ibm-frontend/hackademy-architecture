<ul>
  <li class="ft-fragment"><strong>What</strong> - The set of things being abstracted; the pattern the abstraction is for</li>
  <li class="ft-fragment"><strong>How</strong> - The actual way the abstraction is made available for a given tool</li>
  <li class="ft-fragment"><strong>When & Where</strong> - The state of a thing passing through an abstraction. <span class="small">(state is actually the devil)</span></li>
</ul>
