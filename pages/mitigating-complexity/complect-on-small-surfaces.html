<h3>Complect on Small Surfaces Only</h3>

<ul class="ft-fragment">
  <li>When working with a tool that requires complecting, do so on the <em>smallest surface possible</em></li>
  <li class="ft-fragment">Write simple, non-complected, composable abstractions that can stand on their own</li>
  <li class="ft-fragment">Create a separate, small interface that composes your abstraction with the complected interface for a tool</li>
</ul>
